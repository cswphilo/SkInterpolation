Major

1. More emphasis on Agda formalization

** TODO

2. Some of the motivations for SkNMILL from [12] could also be
imported into the Introduction of the present article, to make it more
self-contained.

** TODO

3. Proof of multiplicity condition

** TODO

-----------------------

Minor

1. The plural form (“logics”) in the title is a bit misleading, since
the authors consider only one such logic, SkNMILL.

** Fixed

2. The font used for SkNMILL is for some strange reason different from
the one used to name other logics: FL, LK.

** The font sticks to the one used in [13]. We could write a sentence about this in the rebuttal letter.

3. On p. 2, the lowermost paragraph: “some of its fragment” should be
“some of its fragments.” Also, here one should more carefully
formulate the antecedent partition condition in the case when the
system becomes commutative (i.e., FL_e ). In this case, in order for
induction to work, Γ should be partitioned into Γ_0 and Γ_1 as a
multiset (ignoring the order).

** Fixed typo

4. On p. 3: a strange linebreak btw. lines 3 and 4; on line 8, “a
derivation h i ” should be “derivations.”

** Fixed

5. On p. 3, line 12: better replace “conjunction” with “product” or
“multiplicative conjunction.”

** Fixed

6. On p. 3, along with the discussion which direction of associativity
holds, and which does not, please include similar notes for
unitality. Also, the terms “semi-associativity” and “semi-unitality”
should be explained before being used.

** notes added and semi-associativity removed

7. The notation A ( B (p. 5 and further) is a bit misleading, since it
is the right division, where A stands to the right: B/A. Maybe, B o- A
would be a better notation. (I do not urge the authors to change the
notation, as -o was already used before in [12], but a remark would be
welcome here.)

** Clarified

8. On p. 6, the third paragraph (“SkNMILL can be seen...”) is a bit
hard to understand, please clarify. (In particular, it is unclear why
one should remove ⊗ and I from the system.)

** Revised, but not sure if the current version meets your original intention

9. On p. 13, line 2: replace ≤ with ⊆; line 3: “in” should be “for”
and “lays” should be “lies;” lines −8 and −7: better write “Maehara
interpolation fails because neither the additive not the
multiplicative conjunction is present.”

** Fixed

10. On p. 20, Theorem 6: the definition of what A -o C being provable
means should be put before the formulation of the theorem, not inside
its proof.

** Definition added

11. There are some issues with the list of references. First, there is
a standard problem with BibTEX aggressively making letters lowercase,
even where it is inappropriate: in personal names (Beth, Gentzen,
Lambek, etc.) and names of calculi (MILL). Second, there are question
marks instead of some data in some of the references to lecture notes
volumes (e.g., [12], [17], [20]). In [26], “Alizaseh” should be
“Alizadeh.”

** Fixed.

12. I would also like to suggest to add some references, as
follows. For the proof of interpolation for the Lambek calculus (in a
strong version, with variable counts), Pentus refers to the following
thesis by Roorda: D. Roorda. Resource Logics: Proof-theoretical
Investigations.  PhD thesis, Fac. Math. and Comp. Sc., University of
Amsterdam, 1991. This reference would be appropriate in the present
article too. For a more global perspective, the authors could also
consult the following recent article: A. A. Tabatabai,
R. Jalali. Universal proof theory: Semi-analytic rules and Craig
interpolation. Ann. Pure Appl. Logic, 176(1), 103509, 2025
