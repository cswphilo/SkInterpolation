When we mention Nonassociative Lambek Calculus, it is worth to cite
the original Lambek paper where he introduced this calculus.

** Added citation to Lambek'61 in first mention of NL

Line 7 from the top: "Substructural logics have **been** proved..."

** Fixed typo

Paragraph 4: It's worth to mention the results for NL, if known.

** The Maehara interpolation property holds also in NL (we have a
proof of this fact in Agda), but we could not find a reference of this
result in the literature.  There exist proofs of other interpolation
theorems for NL, with the variable condition replaced by a certain
complexity condition (as in Buszkowski "Lambek Calculus with
Nonlogical Axioms" and other subsequent papers by the same author),
with the goal of showing that categorial grammars are context-free.
Since we couldn't find a reference, we prefer to remove the sentence.

The end of last line: "**of** n".

I would not treat the paragraph under Proposition 1 as proof. It's
only the description of the proof. I would delete "Proof" for clarity.

** Removed "Proof"

General note to section 3:
We have many big figures. I would move them all to the end of the
section, because now we can have like one or two lines of text on the
page with a figure, which is unreadable.

** Figures have been repositioned to avoid the "page with big figure + small text" issue

Line 8 in the section 4: "two different **forms** of interpolation"

Line 11 from the bottom: "This **is** in fact what..."
