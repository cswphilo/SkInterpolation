We thank the reviewers for carefully reading the revised version of our paper. We have implemented their suggestions by making the following additions:

1. In the end of Section 5, we added a paragraph for a more detailed explanation of why interpolating a sequence of formulae is not reducible to one formula.

2. After the proof of Theorem 5 (in the middle of page 20), we added a short comment about the variable multiplcity condition with polarities in the style of Roorda. The validity of the stronger variable condition has also been formally verified in Agda.
