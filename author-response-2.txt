We thank the reviewers for carefully reading our paper and providing
valuable feedback. In the new version of the paper, we implemented
their suggestions and made the following changes:

1. In the end of Section 5, we added a paragraph for a more detailed explanation of why interpolating a sequence of formulae is not reducible to one formula.

2. After the proof of Theorem 5 (in the middle of page 20), we added a short comment about the valuable multiplcity condition with polarities.
