\abstract{This work studies Craig interpolation for the sequent calculus of skew monoidal closed categories.
Skew monoidal closed categories are a relaxed version of monoidal closed categories, where the structural laws of associativity and left and right unitality, are merely natural transformations with a specific orientation.
The corresponding sequent calculus is semi-substructural because it only admits semi-associativity and semi-unitality, i.e. it is an intermediate logic between non-associative and associative linear logic.
Craig interpolation for various substructural logics has been studied both proof-theoretically and algebraically.
However, it is not clear whether these methods can be applied to semi-substructural logics.
Here we investigate the problem proof-theoretically and show that the sequent calculi for skew monoidal (closed) categories enjoy Craig interpolation by proving a skew version of general interpolation.}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Substructural logics are logic systems that lack at least one of the structural rules, weakening, contraction, and exchange.
Joachim Lambek's syntactic calculus \cite{lambek:mathematics:58} is a well-known example that disallows weakening, contraction, and exchange.
Another example, linear logic, proposed by Jean-Yves Girard \cite{girard:linear:87}, is a substructural logic in which weakening and contraction are in general disallowed but can be recovered for some formulae via modalities.
Substructural logics have been found in numerous applications from computational analysis of natural languages to the development of resource-sensitive programming languages.

\emph{Left skew monoidal categories} \cite{szlachanyi:skew-monoidal:2012} are a weaker variant of MacLane's monoidal categories where the structural morphisms of associativity and unitality are not required to be bidirectional, they are natural transformations with a particular orientation.
Therefore, they can be seen as \emph{semi-associative} and \emph{semi-unital} variants of monoidal categories. 
Left skew monoidal categories arise naturally in the semantics of programming languages \cite{altenkirch:monads:2014}, while the concept of semi-associativity is connected with combinatorial structures like the Tamari lattice and Stasheff associahedra \cite{zeilberger:semiassociative:19}.

In recent years, in collaboration with Tarmo Uustalu and Noam Zeilberger, we started a research project on \emph{semi-substructural} logics, which is inspired by a series of developments on left skew monoidal categories and related variants by Szlach{\'a}nyi, Street, Bourke, Lack and many others \cite{szlachanyi:skew-monoidal:2012,street:skew-closed:2013,lack:triangulations:2014,bourke:skew:2018,bourke:lack:braided:2020}.

We call the internal languages of left skew monoidal categories and their variants \emph{semi-substructural} logics, because they are intermediate logics in between (certain fragments of) non-associative and associative intuitionistic linear logic (or Lambek calculus).
Semi-associativity and semi-unitality are encoded as follows.
Sequents are in the form $S \mid \Gamma \vdash A$, where the antecedent consists of an optional formula $S$, called stoup, adapted from Girard \cite{girard:constructive:91}, and an ordered list of formulae $\Gamma$.
The succedent is a single formula $A$.
We restrict the application of introduction rules in an appropriate way to allow only one of the directions of associativity and unitality.
% the one in the definition of skew monoidal category. For example, left-introduction rules are allowed to act only on the formula in stoup position, not on formulae in $\Gamma$.

This approach has successfully captured internal languages for a variety of categories, including  $(i)$ left skew semigroup \cite{zeilberger:semiassociative:19}, $(ii)$ left skew monoidal \cite{uustalu:sequent:2021}, $(iii)$ left skew (prounital) closed \cite{uustalu:deductive:nodate}, $(iv)$ left skew monoidal closed categories \cite{UVW:protsn,veltri:multifocus:23}, and $(v)$ left distributive skew monoidal categories with finite products and coproducts \cite{VW:2023} through skew variants of the fragments of non-commutative intuitionistic linear logic consisting of combinations of connectives $(\I,\ot,\lolli,\land,\lor)$.
Additionally, discussions have covered partial normality conditions, in which one or more structural morphisms are allowed to have an inverse \cite{uustalu:proof:nodate}, as well as extensions with skew exchange à la Bourke and Lack \cite{veltri:coherence:2021,VW:2023}.

All of the aforementioned calculi with sequents of the form $S \mid \GG \vd A$ are cut-free and therefore, by their rule design, they are decidable.
Moreover, they all admit sound and complete subcalculi inspired by Andreoli's focusing \cite{andreoli:logic:1992} in which
rules are restricted to be applied in a specific order.
A focused calculus provides an algorithm to solve both the proof identity problems for its non-focused calculus and coherence problems for its corresponding variant of left skew monoidal category.

We say a logic $\mc{L}$ has Craig interpolation property if for any formula $A \to C$ provable in $\mc{L}$, there exists a formula $B$ such that $A \to B$ and $B \to C$ are provable in $\mc{L}$, satisfying the variable condition: $\vars{B} \subseteq \vars{A} \cap \vars{C}$ ($\vars{A}$ is the set of atomic formulae appearing in $A$) ($\to$ is the implication connective in $\mc{L}$).\cite{craig:interpolation:1957}.
% The variation of Craig interpolation is defined by replacing the variable condition with that given a set of formulae $\GT$, and given a derivation $f:A \vd^{\GT} C$, if all formulae appearing in $f$ are in $\GT$, then there exists a formula $B \in \GT$ and two derivations $f_0: A\vd^{\GT} B$ and $f_1: B \vd^{\GT} C$. 
% In this paper, we call the former Craig interpolation and the latter weak interpolation.

In this work, we show that sequent calculi for left skew monoidal (closed) categories enjoy Craig interpolation.

% By reversing all structural morphisms and modifying coherence conditions in left skew monoidal closed categories, right skew monoidal closed categories emerge \cite{uustalu:eilenberg-kelly:2020}.
% Moreover, skew bi-closed categories are defined by appropriately integrating left and right skew monoidal closed structures.
% It is natural for us to consider sound sequent calculi for these categories.
% However, the implication rules are not well-behaved when just modeling right skew monoidal closed categories with sequent calculus {\`a} la Girard.

% In short, both problems stem from the skew structure concealed within the flat antecedent of $S \mid \GG \vd A$.
% While the antecedent $S \mid \GG$ is defined similarly to an ordered list, it is actually a tree associating to the left.

% In this work, we analyze and solve these two problems with ideas and methods from non-associative Lambek calculus.
% We start in Section \ref{sec:syntax}, by introducing the sequent calculus {\` a} la Girard (\SkNMILL) for left skew monoidal closed categories from \cite{UVW:protsn} and elaborating its limitation on having interpolation.
% By generalizing the method in \cite{ono:proof:nonclassical:1998}, we prove interpolation for a cut-free sequent calculus \LSkT, which is inspired by sequent calculus 
% for non-associative Lambek calculus \cite{bulinska:2009,moot:categorial:2012} and equivalent to \SkNMILL.
% The antecedents of sequents in \LSkT~are trees, which save us from discussing impossible cases when proving interpolation.
% Moreover, by the equivalence between \SkNMILL~and \LSkT, we can prove a special form of interpolation for \SkNMILL~via \LSkT.

% In Section \ref{sec:skew:categories}, we introduce definitions of left (right) skew monoidal closed categories and skew bi-closed categories, and normality conditions for skew categories.
% In Section \ref{sec:calculi:skbic}, we describe two calculi for skew bi-closed categories: one is an axiomatic calculus (\SkBiCA), while the other is a sequent calculus (\SkBiCT) similar to the multimodal non-associative Lambek calculus \cite{moortgat:multimodl:1996}.
% In Section \ref{sec:algebraic:relational:model}, we introduce the relational semantics for \SkBiCA.
% We define the relational semantics via a Kripke frame with two ternary relations and show that the partially ordered set which consists of subsets of possible worlds with appropriate operations is a thin skew bi-closed category.
% Furthermore, by theorem (\ref{thm:main}), we can prove a thin version of main theorems in \cite{uustalu:eilenberg-kelly:2020}.

\section{Sequent Calculus}\label{sec:syntax}
Recall the sequent calculus (\SkNMILL) for left skew monoidal closed categories from \cite{UVW:protsn}, which is a skew variant of non-commutative multiplicative intuitionistic linear logic.

Formulae ($\mf{Fma}$) are inductively generated by the grammar $A, B::= X \ | \ \I \ | \ A \ot B \ | \ A \lolli B$, where $X$ comes from a set $\mathsf{At}$ of atoms, $\I$ is a multiplicative unit, $\ot$ is multiplicative conjunction and $\lolli$ is a linear implication.

A sequent is a triple of the form $S \mid \Gamma \vd A$, where the antecedent splits into: an optional formula $S$, called \emph{stoup} \cite{girard:constructive:91}, and an ordered list of formulae $\Gamma$ and succedent $A$ is a single formula.
The symbol $S$ consistently denotes a stoup, meaning $S$ can either be a single formula or empty, indicated as $S = {-}$; furthermore, $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ always represent atomic formulae.
% The design of sequents is from previous work on syntactic characterizations for skew structures \cite{uustalu:sequent:2021,uustalu:proof:nodate,uustalu:deductive:nodate,veltri:coherence:2021}.
% The peculiar design of sequents, involving the presence of the stoup in the antecedent, comes from previous work on deductive systems with skew structure by Uustalu, Veltri and Zeilberger \cite{uustalu:sequent:2021,uustalu:proof:nodate,uustalu:deductive:nodate,veltri:coherence:2021}.

Derivations are generated recursively by the following rules:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:seqcalc:skmc:Gir}
	  % \def\arraystretch{2.5}
	  \begin{array}{c}
		\infer[\ax]{A \mid \quad \vd A}{}
		\quad
		\infer[\lleft]{A \lolli B \mid \Gamma , \Delta \vd C}{
		  {-} \mid \Gamma \vd A
		  &
		  B \mid \Delta \vd C
		}
		\quad
		\infer[\unitl]{\I \mid \Gamma \vd C}{{-} \mid \Gamma \vd C}
		\quad
		\infer[\tl]{A \ot B \mid \Gamma \vd C}{A \mid B , \Gamma \vd C}
		\\[5pt]
    \infer[\pass]{{-} \mid A , \Gamma \vd C}{A \mid \Gamma \vd C}
		\quad
		\infer[\lright]{S \mid \Gamma \vd A \lolli B}{S \mid \Gamma , A \vd B}
		\quad
		\infer[\unitr]{{-} \mid \quad \vd \I}{}
		\quad
		\infer[\tr]{S \mid \Gamma , \Delta \vd A \ot B}{
		  S \mid \Gamma \vd A
		  &
		  {-} \mid \Delta \vd B
		}
	  \end{array}
    % \begin{array}{c}
		% \infer[\ax]{A \mid \quad \vd A}{}
		% \quad
    %         \infer[\pass]{{-} \mid A , \Gamma \vd C}{A \mid \Gamma \vd C}
		% \quad
    %         \infer[\unitr]{{-} \mid \quad \vd \I}{}
    %         \quad
		% \infer[\unitl]{\I \mid \Gamma \vd C}{{-} \mid \Gamma \vd C}
		% \\[5pt]
    %         \infer[\tl]{A \ot B \mid \Gamma \vd C}{A \mid B , \Gamma \vd C}
		% \quad
		% \infer[\tr]{S \mid \Gamma , \Delta \vd A \ot B}{
		%   S \mid \Gamma \vd A
		%   &
		%   {-} \mid \Delta \vd B
		% }
		% \\[5pt]
		% \infer[\lleft]{A \lolli B \mid \Gamma , \Delta \vd C}{
		%   {-} \mid \Gamma \vd A
		%   &
		%   B \mid \Delta \vd C
		% }
		% \quad
		% \infer[\lright]{S \mid \Gamma \vd A \lolli B}{S \mid \Gamma , A \vd B}
	  % \end{array}
	\end{equation}
The inference rules in (\ref{eq:seqcalc:skmc:Gir}) are similar to the ones in the sequent calculus for non-commutative multiplicative intuitionistic linear logic (\NMILL) \cite{abrusci:noncommutative:1990}, but with some crucial differences: 
% $(i)$ The left logical rules $\unitl$, $\tl$ and $\lleft$, read bottom-up, are only allowed to be applied on the formula in the stoup position. $(ii)$ The right tensor rule $\tr$, read bottom-up, splits the antecedent of a sequent $S \mid \Gamma, \Delta \vd A \ot B$ and in the case where $S$ is a formula, $S$ is always moved to the stoup of the left premise, even if $\Gamma$ is empty.
% $(iii)$ The presence of the stoup distinguishes two types of antecedents, $A \mid \Gamma$ and ${-} \mid A, \Gamma$. The structural rule $\pass$ (for `passivation'), read bottom-up, allows the moving of the leftmost formula in the context to the stoup position whenever the stoup is empty.
% $(iv)$ The logical connectives of \NMILL\ (and associative Lambek calculus) typically include two ordered implications $\lolli$ and $\illol$, which are two variants of linear implication arising from the removal of the exchange rule from intuitionistic linear logic. In \SkNMILL~only the left implication $\lolli$ (right residuation in Lambek calculus) is present. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The left logical rules $\unitl$, $\tl$ and $\lleft$, read bottom-up, are only allowed to be applied on the formula in the stoup position.
% In particular, there is no general way to remove a unit $\I$ nor decompose a tensor $A \ot B$ if these formulae are located in the context and not in the stoup
%  (we will see in (\ref{eq:lleft:gen}) that something can actually be done to deal with implications $A \lolli B$ in the context).
\item The right tensor rule $\tr$, read bottom-up, splits the antecedent of a sequent $S \mid \Gamma, \Delta \vd A \ot B$ and in the case where $S$ is a formula, $S$ is always moved to the stoup of the left premise, even if $\Gamma$ is empty.
% whereby the formula in the stoup, in case such a formula is present, has to be moved to the stoup of the first premise. In particular, the stoup formula of the conclusion cannot be moved to the antecedent of the second premise even if $\Gamma$ is chosen to be empty.
\item The presence of the stoup distinguishes two types of antecedents, $A \mid \Gamma$ and ${-} \mid A, \Gamma$. The structural rule $\pass$ (for `passivation'), read bottom-up, allows the moving of the leftmost formula in the context to the stoup position whenever the stoup is empty.
\item The logical connectives of \NMILL~typically include two ordered implications $\lolli$ and $\illol$, which are two variants of linear implication arising from the removal of the exchange rule from intuitionistic linear logic. In here, only the left implication $\lolli$ is present. 
% It is currently not clear to us whether the inclusion of the second implication to our logic is a meaningful addition and whether it corresponds to some particular categorical notion.
\end{enumerate}
% The restrictions in 1--4 are essential for precisely capturing all the features of skew monoidal closed categories and nothing more, as we discuss in Section \ref{sec:catsem}.
% Notice also that, similarly to the case of \NMILL, all structural rules of exchange, contraction, and weakening are absent. We give names to derivations and we write $f: S \mid \Gamma \vdash A$ when $f$ is a particular derivation of the sequent $S \mid \Gamma \vdash A$.
For a more detailed explanation and an interpretation of the system as a logic of resources, see \cite[Section 2]{UVW:protsn}.
% a linear logical interpretation of the calculus

This calculus is sound and complete wrt. left skew monoidal closed categories and cut-free, i.e., following two rules are admissible:
\begin{displaymath}
      \infer[\mathsf{scut}]{S \mid \Gamma , \Delta \vd C}{
        \deduce{S \mid \Gamma \vd A}{}
        &
        \deduce{A \mid \Delta \vd C}{}
      }
      \qquad
      \infer[\mathsf{ccut}]{S \mid \Delta_0 , \Gamma , \Delta_1 \vd C}{
        \deduce{{-} \mid \Gamma \vd A}{}
        &
        \deduce{S \mid \Delta_0 , A , \Delta_1 \vd C}{}
      }
    \end{displaymath}
\section{Interpolation}
In this section, we adapt Maehara's method to prove \SkNMILL~enjoys Craig interpolation.
Maehara's method is based on cut-free sequent calculi, and the process is that we prove a general version of interpolation, and then Craig interpolation would become a corollary.
For instance, given a cut-free sequent calculus for associative Lambek calculus, the general version of interpolation is \cite{ono:proof:nonclassical:1998}:

  \item[\ ] Given $f : \Gamma \vdash C$ and any partition $\langle \Gamma_0, \Gamma_1, \Gamma_2 \rangle$ of $\Gamma$, there exist a formula $D$ and two derivations $g : \Gamma_1 \vdash D$ and $h : \Gamma_0, D, \Gamma_1 \vdash C$, and $\vars{D} \subseteq \vars{\Gamma_0} \cap \vars{\Gamma_0, \Gamma_1, C}$ ($\vars{A}$ is the set of atomic formulae appearing in $A$ and $\vars{\Gamma}$ means $\bigcup \vars{A_i}$ for $A_i \in \Gamma$).
\end{itemize}
The proof proceeds by induction on the height of derivations and we should exhaust all cases of any partition.

In the case of \SkNMILL, we should prove following two lemmata of general interpolation.
These two lemmata are proved mutually by induction on derivations. 
We separate the proof into two parts for readability.
\begin{lemma}
~
($\mf{scut}$-interpolation) Given $f: S \mid \Gamma \vd C$ and any partition $\langle \GG_0,\GG_1 \rangle$ of $\GG$, there exist a formula $D$ and two derivations $g : S \mid \GG_0 \vd D$ and $h : D \mid \GG_1 \vd C$, and $\vars{D} \subseteq \vars{S, \GG_0} \cap \vars{\GG_1, C}$.
%   , where $s(S) = I$ if $S = {-}$ or $s(S) = B$ if $S = B$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The first base case is $f = \ax : A \mid \quad \vd A$, which enforces $\GG_0 = \GG_1 = [\ ]$.
In this case, the interpolant formula is $A$ and $g = h = f = \ax : A \mid \quad \vd A$, where the variable condition is automatically satisfied.
Another base case is $f = \unitr : {-} \mid \quad \vd A$.
Similarly, $\GG_0$ and $\GG_1$ are enforced to be empty lists.
In this case, the interpolant formulae is $\I$ and $g = f = \unitr : {-} \mid \quad \vd \I$ and $h = \unitl (\unitr) : \I \mid \quad \vd \I$, where the variable condition is vacuously satisfied.

For inductive cases, we first deal with one-premise rules.
The first group of one-premise rules are $\unitl, \tl$, and $\lright$.
We show the case of $f = \unitl \ f'$, while the other two are similar.
Given a derivation $\unitl \ f' : \I \mid \GG \vd C$ and a partition $\langle \GG_0, \GG_1 \rangle$ of $\GG$, we apply induction on $f'$ with the same partition of $\GG$ and then obtain a formula $D$ and two derivations $g' : {-} \mid \GG_0 \vd D$ and $h' : D \mid \GG_1 \vd C$, where $\vars{D} \subseteq \vars{\GG_0} \cap \vars{\GG_1, C}$.
In this case, the interpolant formula for $f$ is $D$, and two desired derivations are $g = \unitl \ g'$ and $h = h'$.
The variable condition is satisfied because $\vars{\I} = \emptyset$.

The last case of one-premise rules is $ f = \pass \ f'$.
There are two subcases determined by the partition of $\GG$, specifically, $\GG_0$ is an empty list or not. 
If $\GG_0 = [\ ]$, then the interpolant is $\I$ and two desired derivations are $\unitr$ and $\unitl (\pass \ f')$.
The variable condition is vacuously satisfied.
If $\GG_0 = A, \GG'_0$, then we apply induction on $f'$ with the partition $\langle \GG'_0, \GG_1 \rangle$ and then obtain a formula $D$ and two derivations $g' : A \mid \GG'_0 \vd D$ and $h' : D \mid \GG_1 \vd C$, where $\vars{D} \subseteq \vars{A, \GG'_0} \cap \vars{\GG_1, C}$.
In this case, the interpolant formula for $f$ is $D$, and two desired derivations are $g = \pass \ g'$ and $h = h'$.
The variable condition is satisfied by the inductive hypothesis.

For two-premises rules, we first check $f = \tr (f',f'')$.
The first case of $\tr$ is the partition $\langle (\GG_0, \GG_1), \GG_2 \rangle$ ($\GG_1$ is a non-empty list) with $f' : S \mid \GG_0 \vd A$ and $f'': {-} \mid \GG_1, \GG_2 \vd B$.
In this case, we apply induction on $f'$ with the partition $\langle \GG_0 , [\ ] \rangle $and $f''$ with the partition $\langle \GG_1 , \GG_2 \rangle$ respectively to obtain
\begin{itemize}
  \item[--] a formula $E$ and two derivations $g' : S \mid \GG_0 \vd E$, $h' : E \mid \quad \vd A$ such that $\vars{E} \subseteq \vars{S, \GG_0} \cap \vars{A}$, and
  \item[--] a formula $F$ and two derivations $g'' : {-} \mid \GG_1 \vd F$ and $h'' : F \mid \GG_2 \vd B$ such that $\vars{F} \subseteq \vars{\GG_1} \cap \vars{\GG_2, B}$.
\end{itemize}
Then the interpolant formula is $E \ot F$ and the desired derivations are
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{c}
  \begin{array}{c}
    g
  \end{array}
  \quad
  =
  \quad
  \begin{array}{c}
    \infer[\tr]{S \mid \GG_0 , \GG_1 \vd E \ot F}{
      \deduce{S \mid \GG_0 \vd E}{g'}
      &
      \deduce{{-} \mid \GG_1 \vd F}{g''}
    }
  \end{array}
    \quad
    \begin{array}{c}
      h
    \end{array}
    \quad
    =
    \quad
    \begin{array}{c}
      \infer[\tl]{E \ot F \mid \GG_2 \vd A \ot B}{
      \infer[\tr]{E \mid F , \GG_2 \vd A \ot B}{
        \deduce{E \mid \quad \vd A}{h'}
        &
        \infer[\pass]{{-} \mid F , \GG_2 \vd B}{
          \deduce{F \mid \GG_2 \vd B}{h''}
        }
      }
    }
    \end{array}
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
The variable condition is satisfied because $\vars{E \ot F} = \vars{E} \cup \vars{F} \subseteq \vars{S , \GG_0} \cup \vars{\GG_1} = \vars{S, \GG_0 , \GG_1}$ and $\vars{E \ot F} = \vars{E} \cup \vars{F} \subseteq \vars{A} \cup \vars{\GG_2 , B} = \vars{A, \GG_2 , B} = \vars{\GG_2, A \ot B}$.

The second case of $\tr$ is the partition $\langle \GG_0, (\GG_1 , \GG_2) \rangle$ ($\GG_1$ is possibly empty) with $f' : S \mid \GG_0 , \GG_1 \vd A$ and $f'' : {-} \mid \GG_2 \vd B$.
In this case, we apply induction on $f'$ with the partition $\langle \GG_0 , \GG_1 \rangle$ and then obtain a formula $D$ and two derivations $g' : S \mid \GG_0 \vd D$ and $h' : D \mid \GG_1 \vd A$ such that $\vars{D} \subseteq \vars{S, \GG_0} \cap \vars{\GG_1 , A}$.
The interpolant formula is $D$ and the desired derivations are $g = g'$ and $h = \tr (h' , f'') : D \mid \GG_1 , \GG_2 \vd A \ot B$.
The variable condition is satisfied because $\vars{D} \subseteq \vars{S, \GG_0} \cap \vars{\GG_1 , A} \subseteq \vars{S, \GG_0} \cap \vars{\GG_1 , \GG_2 , A \ot B}$.

The first case of $\lleft$ is the partition $\langle \GG_0, (\GG_1, \GG_2) \rangle$ ($\GG_1$ is non-empty) for $\GG$ with $f' : {-} \mid \GG_0, \GG_1 \vd A$ and $f'': B \mid \GG_2 \vd C$.
Our goal is to find a formula $D$ and derivations $g : A\lolli B \mid \GG_0 \vd D$ and $h: D \mid \GG_1, \GG_2 \vd C$.
We first apply inductive hypothesis of $\mf{ccut}$-interpolation on $f'$ with the partition $\langle \GG_0 , \GG_1 , [\ ]\rangle$ and obtain 
\begin{itemize}
  \item[--] a partition $\langle \GD_1, \dots , \GD_n \rangle$ of $\GG_1$,
  \item[--] a list of formulae $D_1 , \dots , D_n$, and 
  \item[--] derivations $g': {-} \mid \GG_0 , D_1, \dots, D_n \vd A$ and $h'_i : {-} \mid \GD_i \vd D_i$, for $i \in [1\dots n]$
\end{itemize}
such that $\vars{D_1 , \dots , D_n} \subseteq \vars{\GD_1 , \dots , \GD_n} \cap \vars{\GG_0 , A}$.
\\
By applying inductive hypothesis of $\mf{scut}$-interpolation on $f''$ with the partition $\langle [\ ] , \GG_2 \rangle$, we obtain a formula $E$ and derivations $g'' : B \mid \quad \vd E$ and $h'': E \mid \GG_2 \vd C$ such that $\vars{E} \subseteq \vars{B} \cap \vars{\GG_2 , C}$.
Then we construct the desired derivations as follows:
% \begin{displaymath}

    }
    \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
Notice that $\GG_1 = \GD_1, \dots, \GD_n$, so the variable condition is easy to check.

The second case of $\lleft$ is the partition $\langle (\GG_0 , \GG_1) , \GG_2 \rangle$ ($\GG_1$ is possibly empty) with derivations $f' : {-} \mid \GG_0 \vd A$ and $f'' : B \mid \GG_1 , \GG_2 \vd C$.
In this case, we apply the inductive hypothesis of $\mf{scut}$-interpolation on $f''$ with the partition $\langle \GG_1 , \GG_2 \rangle$ and then obtain a formula $D$, and two derivations $g'' : B \mid \GG_1 \vd D$ and $h'' : D \mid \GG_2 \vd C$ such that $\vars{D} \subseteq \vars{B , \GG_1} \cap \vars{\GG_2 , C}$.
The interpolant formula is $D$ and the desired derivations are $g = \lleft (f' , g'') : A \lolli B \mid \GG_0 , \GG_1 \vd D$ and $h = h''$.
The variable condition is satisfied because $\vars{D} \subseteq \vars{B , \GG_1} \cap \vars{\GG_2 , C} \subseteq \vars{A \lolli B , \GG_0 , \GG_1} \cap \vars{\GG_2 , C}$.
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
~
  ($\mf{ccut}$-interpolation) Given $f: S \mid \Gamma \vd C$ and any partition $\langle \GG_0,\GG_1, \GG_2 \rangle$ of $\GG$, there exist a partition of $\langle \GD_1, \dots, \GD_n \rangle$ of $\GG_1$, a list of interpolant formulae $D_1, \dots, D_n$ and derivations $g: S \mid \GG_0, D_1, \dots, D_n, \GG_2 \vd C$ and $h_i : {-} \mid \GD_i \vd D_i$ for $i \in [1\dots n]$ such that $\vars{D_1, \dots, D_n} \subseteq \vars{\GD_1, \dots, \GD_n} \cap \vars{S, \GG_0, \GG_2, C}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The first base case is $f  = \ax : A \mid \quad \vd A$, which means that $\GG_0 = \GG_1 = \GG_2 = [\ ]$.
In this case, the partition of $\GG_1$ is $\langle [\ ] \rangle$ and the list of formulae and list of derivations are empty lists.
Another base case $f = \unitr$ is similar.

For inductive cases, we first deal with one-premise rules. 
The first group of rules are $\unitl$, $\tl$, and $\lright$. 
We show the case of $f = \unitl \ f'$, while the other two are similar.
Given a derivation $\unitl \ f' : \I \mid \GG \vd C$ and a partition $\langle \GG_0 , \GG_1 , \GG_2\rangle$ of $\GG$.
By induction, we have 
\begin{itemize}
  \item[--] a partition $\langle \GD_0, \dots , \GD_0 \rangle$ of $\GG_1$, 
  \item[--] a list of interpolant formulae $D_1, \dots , D_n$ and
  \item[--] derivations $g' : {-} \mid \GG_0 , D_1 , \dots , D_n , \GG_2 \vd C$ and $h'_i : {-} \mid \GD_i \vd D_i$, for $i \in [1 \dots n]$ 
\end{itemize}
such that $\vars{D_1 , \dots , D_n} \subseteq \vars{\GD_1, \dots , \GD_n} \cap \vars{S, \GG_0 , \GG_2 , C}$.
In this case, the partition, the list of interpolant formulae are the same as the inductive hypothesis.
The desired derivations are $g = \unitl \ g'$ and $h_i = h'_i$ for $i \in [1 \dots n]$.
The variable condition is automatically satisfied.

The critical case among one-premise rules is $f = \pass \ f'$, with the partition $\langle [\ ], (A, \GG_1) , \GG_2 \rangle$ and derivation $f' : A \mid \GG_1 , \GG_2 \vd C$.
In this case, we apply the inductive hypothesis of $\mf{scut}$-interpolation on $f'$ and obtain derivations $g': A \mid \GG_1 \vd D$ and $h' : D \mid \GG_2 \vd C$.
The desired derivations are $\pass \ g' : {-} \mid A , \GG_1 \vd D$ and $\pass \ h' : {-} \mid D, \GG_2 \vd C$, i.e. the partition of $A, \GG_1$ is itself and the list of formulae is the singleton list $[D]$.
The variable condition is automatically satisfied.

Next we deal with two-premises rules.
We show the case $f = \tr (f' , f'')$, while the case of $\lleft$ is similar.
Given a derivation $\tr (f' , f'')$, where $f' : S \mid \GL \vd A$ and $f'' : {-} \mid \GO \vd B$ and the partition $\langle \GG_0 , \GG_1, \GG_2 \rangle$ of $(\GL, \GO)$, there are three cases:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If $\GG_0 = (\GG'_0 , \GG''_0)$ where $\GL = \GG'_0$ and $\GO = (\GG''_0 , \GG_1 , \GG_2)$, then we apply induction on $f''$ to obtain
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[--] a partition $\langle \GD_0, \dots , \GD_0 \rangle$ of $\GG_1$, 
    \item[--] a list of interpolant formulae $D_1, \dots , D_n$ and
    \item[--] derivations $g'' : {-} \mid \GG''_0 , D_1 , \dots , D_n , \GG_2 \vd B$ and $h''_i : {-} \mid \GD_i \vd D_i$, for $i \in [1 \dots n]$ 
  \end{itemize}
  such that $\vars{D_1 , \dots , D_n} \subseteq \vars{\GD_1, \dots , \GD_n} \cap \vars{ \GG''_0 , \GG_2 , B}$.
  The desired derivations are $\tr (f' , g'')$ and $h_i = h''_i$ for $i \in [1 \dots n]$.
  The variable condition is satisfied because $\vars{D_1 , \dots , D_n} \subseteq \vars{\GD_1, \dots , \GD_n} \cap \vars{ \GG''_0 , \GG_2 , B} \subseteq \vars{\GD_1, \dots , \GD_n} \cap \vars{S, \GG'_0, \GG''_0 , \GG_2 , A \ot B}$.
  \item If $\GG_1 = (\GG'_1 , \GG''_1)$ where $\GL = (\GG_0 , \GG'_1)$ and $\GO = (\GG''_1 , \GG_2)$, then we apply induction on $f'$ and $f''$ respectively to obtain
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[--] a partition $\langle \GD'_0, \dots , \GD'_0 \rangle$ of $\GG'_1$,
    \item[--] a list of interpolant formulae $D'_1, \dots , D'_n$ and
    \item[--] derivations $g' : S \mid \GG_0 , D'_1 , \dots , D'_n \vd A$ and $h'_i : {-} \mid \GD'_i \vd D'_i$, for $i \in [1 \dots n]$
  \end{itemize}
  such that $\vars{D'_1 , \dots , D'_n} \subseteq \vars{\GD'_1, \dots , \GD'_n} \cap \vars{ S, \GG_0 , A}$ and
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[--] a partition $\langle \GD''_0, \dots , \GD''_0 \rangle$ of $\GG''_1$,
    \item[--] a list of interpolant formulae $D''_1, \dots , D''_m$ and
    \item[--] derivations $g'' : {-} \mid D''_{n+1} , \dots , D''_{n+m} , \GG_2 \vd B$ and $h''_i : {-} \mid \GD''_i \vd D''_i$, for $i \in [n+1 \dots n+m]$
  \end{itemize}
  such that $\vars{D''_{n+1} , \dots , D''_{n+m}} \subseteq \vars{\GD''_{n+1}, \dots , \GD''_{n+m}} \cap \vars{\GG_2 , B}$.
  The desired derivations are $\tr(g' , g'') : S \mid \GG_0 , D'_1 , \dots , D'_n , D''_{n+1} , \dots , D''_{n+m} , \GG_2 \vd A \ot B$ and $h_i = h'_i$ if $i \leq n$, otherwise $h_i = h''_i$ for $i \in [1 \dots n+m]$.
  We abbreviate $D'_1 , \dots , D'_n$ as $[D']$, $\GD'_1, \dots , \GD'_n$ as $[\GD']$, $D''_{n+1} , \dots , D''_{n+m}$ as $[D'']$, and $\GD''_{n+1}, \dots , \GD''_{n+m}$ as $[\GD'']$. 
  For the variable condition, we argue that 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[--] by inductive hypothesis, we know that $\vars{[D']} \subseteq \vars{[\GD']}$ and $\vars{[D'']} \subseteq \vars{[\GD'']}$;
    \item[--] by the definition of $\mf{var}$, we have $\vars{[D'], [D'']} \subseteq \vars{[\GD'] , [\GD'']}$;
    \item[--] by inductive hypothesis, we know that $\vars{[D']} \subseteq \vars{ S, \GG_0 , A}$ and $\vars{[D'']} \subseteq \vars{\GG_2 , B}$;
    \item[--] by the definition of $\mf{var}$, we have $\vars{[D'], [D'']} \subseteq \vars{ S, \GG_0 , A , \GG_2 , B} = \vars{S , \GG_0 , \GG_2 , A \ot B}$
  \end{itemize}
  Therefore, $\vars{[D'], [D'']} \subseteq \vars{[\GD'] , [\GD'']} \cap \vars{S , \GG_0 , \GG_2 , A \ot B}$, as desired.
  % By inductive hypothesis, we know that $\vars{[D']} \subseteq \vars{[\GD']}$ and $\vars{[D'']} \subseteq \vars{[\GD'']}$.
  % By the definition of $\mf{var}$, we have $\vars{[D'], [D'']} \subseteq \vars{[\GD'] , [\GD'']}$.
  % By inductive hypothesis, we know that $\vars{[D']} \subseteq \vars{ S, \GG_0 , A}$ and $\vars{[D'']} \subseteq \vars{\GG_2 , B}$.
  % By the definition of $\mf{var}$, we have $\vars{[D'], [D'']} \subseteq \vars{ S, \GG_0 , A , \GG_2 , B} = \vars{S , \GG_0 , \GG_2 , A \ot B}$.
  % Therefore, $\vars{[D'], [D'']} \subseteq \vars{[\GD'] , [\GD'']} \cap \vars{S , \GG_0 , \GG_2 , A \ot B}$, as desired.
  \item The case $\GG_2 = (\GG'_2 , \GG''_2)$ where $\GL = \GG_0 , \GG_1, \GG'_2$ and $\GO = \GG''_2$ is similar to the first case.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}
  For any formulae $A$ and $C$, if $A \lolli C$ is provable, then there exists a formula $B$ such that both $A \lolli B$ and $B \lolli C$ are provable, and $\vars{B} \subseteq \vars{A} \cap \vars{C}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
$A \lolli C$ being provable means that there is a derivation $f : {-} \mid \quad \vd A \lolli C$. 
If we attempt to prove by induction on $f$, then the base case is that $f = \lright \ f'$, where $f' : {-} \mid A \vd B$, which is not well-formed for the inductive hypothesis.

Then by applying $\mf{scut}$-interpolation on the $f'$ above with the partition $\langle [A ], [\ ]\rangle$, we get a formula $B$ and two derivations $g': {-} \mid A \vd B$ and $h': B \mid \quad \vd C$, where $\vars{B}\subseteq \vars{A}$ and $\vars{B} \subseteq \vars{[\ ], C} = \vars{C}$.
The formulae $A \lolli B$ and $B \lolli C$ are proved by the derivations $\lright \ g' : {-} \mid \quad \vd A \lolli B$ and $\lright (\pass \ h') : {-} \mid \quad \vd B \lolli C$, respectively. 

The arguments above also apply to the sequent calculus for left skew monoidal categories in \cite{uustalu:sequent:2021}.
%  however, it is impossible to find such $D$, $f'_0$, and $f'_1$ by induction without $\mf{ccut}$ interpolation.
% then $D$ is the correct interpolant because we have $\lleft \ f'_0 \ f'' : A \lolli B \mid \GG_0, D, \GG_2 \vd C$ and the variable condition is satisfied.
% However, it is impossible to find $D$, $f'_0$, and $f'_1$ by induction without $\mf{ccut}$ interpolation.
% \paragraph*{Remark}
\end{proof}

The statement of $\mf{ccut}$-interpolation does not align with the general structure of interpolation in non-commutative substructural logic, because the general form of the statement is unprovable in \SkNMILL.
To illustrate this, consider the following statement:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[\ ] ($\mf{ccut'}$-interpolation) Given $f: S \mid \Gamma \vd C$ and any partition $\langle \GG_0,\GG_1, \GG_2 \rangle$ of $\GG$, there exist a formula $D$ and two derivations  $g : {-} \mid \GG_1 \vd D$ and $h : S \mid \GG_0, D, \GG_2 \vd C$, and $\vars{D} \subseteq \vars{\GG_1} \cap \vars{S, \GG_0, \GG_2, C}$.
\end{itemize}
The critical case is $f = \tr (f',f'')$ with the partition $\langle \GG_0, (\GG'_1, \GG''_1), \GG_2\rangle$ and two derivations $f' : S \mid \GG_0 , \GG'_1 \vd A$ and $f'' : {-} \mid \GG''_1 , \GG_2 \vd B$.
By induction on $f'$ and the partition $\langle \GG_0 , \GG'_1, [\ ] \rangle$, and on $f''$ and the partition $\langle [\ ], \GG''_1, \GG_2\rangle$ respectively, we have a formula $D$, $g' : {-} \mid \GG'_1 \vd D$, and $h': S \mid \GG_0 , D \vd A$ and a formula $E$, $g'' : {-} \mid \GG''_1 \vd E$ and $h'': {-} \mid E, \GG_2 \vd B$.
We obtain $\tr (g',g'') : {-} \mid \GG'_1, \GG''_1 \vd D \ot E$ and $\tr (h', h'') : S \mid \GG_0, D, E, \GG_1 \vd A \ot B$, so the last step is to produce $D \ot E$ in the latter.
But we get stuck because $\tl$ cannot be applied on formulae in context.

For example, suppose $f = \tr (f',f''): X \mid Y, Z \vd (X\ot Y)\ot Z$ where $f':X \mid Y \vd X\ot Y$ and $f'': {-} \mid Z \vd Z$, then given the partition $\langle [\ ], (Y,Z), [\ ]\rangle$, our goal is to find a formula $D$ and two derivations $g: {-} \mid Y, Z \vd D$ and $X \mid D \vd (X\ot Y)\ot Z$.
Because $Y$ and $Z$ are atomic, the only possibility is that $D = Y \ot Z$, however, the sequent $X \mid Y \ot Z \vd (X \ot Y) \ot Z$ does not have a proof in \SkNMILL.
\begin{equation*}\label{example:ccut:failure}
  \small\begin{array}{c}
    \infer[\tr]{X \mid Y \ot Z \vd (X \ot Y) \ot Z}{
    \deduce{X \mid Y\ot Z \vd X \ot Y}{??}
    &
    \deduce{{-} \mid \quad \vd Z}{??}
  }
  \qquad
  \infer[\tr]{X \mid Y \ot Z \vd (X \ot Y) \ot Z}{
    \infer[\tr]{X \mid \quad \vd X \ot Y}{
      \infer[\ax]{X \mid \quad \vd X}{}
      &
      \deduce{{-} \mid \quad \vd Y}{??}
    }
    &
    \infer[\pass]{{-} \mid Y \ot Z \vd Z}{
      \infer[\tl]{Y \ot Z \mid \quad \vd Z}{
        \deduce{Y \mid Z \vd Z}{??}
      }
    }
  }
  \end{array}
\end{equation*}
In general, the rule
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{c}
  \infer[\ot\mf{C}]{S \mid \GG , A \ot B , \GD \vd C}{
    \deduce{S \mid \GG, A , B , \GD \vd C}{}
  }
\end{array}
\end{displaymath}
is not admissible in \SkNMILL.

\section{Formalization}
In this ongoing work, we show that sequent calculi for left skew monoidal (closed) categories enjoy Craig interpolation.
The proofs of two statements of generalized interpolation are formalized in the proof assistant Agda.
The code is available at

  \url{https://github.com/niccoloveltri/code-skewmonclosed/tree/interpolation}.
\end{center}
For the future, we would like to extend the result to other semi-substructural logics in \cite{veltri:coherence:2021,VW:2023}.
